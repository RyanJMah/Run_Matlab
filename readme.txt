Setup Steps:
	1 - Add "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2020a\bin" (or wherever you installed matlab) to your system's environment variables
	2 - cd into this path and run "pip install --editable ."
	3 - to test if everything is working, run 'mat test.m' and you should see "Hello world!" be printed to your console


Now you can cd into where you have a ".m" file and run "mat <filename>.m" and it will run in console.
